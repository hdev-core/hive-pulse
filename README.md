# Hive Frontend Switcher - Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome Extension built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS that allows users to seamlessly switch between different Hive blockchain interfaces (PeakD, Ecency, Hive.blog, InLeo, Actifit) while preserving your current navigation context. It also serves as a utility tool to monitor your **Voting Power (VP)** and **Resource Credits (RC)** in real-time.

## Features

*   **Context Preservation:** Detects the current post, profile, or feed you are viewing and redirects you to the exact same page on the target frontend.
*   **Account Stats Monitoring:**
    *   **Voting Power (VP):** Monitor your current voting power percentage to optimize curation rewards.
    *   **Resource Credits (RC):** Track your mana to ensure you have enough credits for transactions.
    *   **Extension Badge:** Display your current VP (default) or RC % directly on the browser extension icon. Background monitoring updates this every 15 minutes.
    *   **Mini Dashboard:** Quickly view stats on the main screen without navigating away.
*   **Action Modes:**
    *   **Link (Default):** Switches the current view to another frontend.
    *   **Wallet:** Takes you directly to the wallet page on the selected frontend (context-aware: if you are viewing a user's profile, it opens *their* wallet).
    *   **Post:** Opens the "Compose/Publish" editor on the selected frontend.
*   **Navigation Control:** Toggle between opening links in the **Same Tab** (default) or a **New Tab**.
*   **Username Detection:** Automatically extracts usernames from URLs (e.g., `/@alice`) to provide smarter navigation.
*   **Supported Frontends:** PeakD, Ecency, Hive.blog, InLeo, Actifit, Waivio, Liketu, HiveScan.
*   **DApp Launcher:** Quick access to popular Hive DApps (Splinterlands, 3Speak, Hive-Engine, etc.).

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- NPM or Yarn

## Installation & Compilation

1.  **Initialize the project (if you haven't already):**
    If you are creating this from scratch, ensure you have a `package.json`. If not, run:
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    npm install react react-dom lucide-react
    npm install -D typescript @types/react @types/react-dom vite @vitejs/plugin-react tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    ```

2.  **Setup Tailwind:**
    Generate config:
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
    (Note: The code provided uses the CDN version of Tailwind in `index.html` for simplicity in this specific output format, but for a production extension, you should configure the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` and import CSS in `index.tsx`).

3.  **Build the Extension:**
    Since this is a React app using Vite, you need to build it into static files that Chrome can read.

    Update your `package.json` scripts:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "build": "vite build"
    }
    ```

    Create a `vite.config.ts` (if not already present) that is configured to output to a `dist` folder.

    Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    *Note: The build process automatically copies `manifest.json` and `icon.svg` to the `dist` folder.*

## Loading into Chrome

1.  Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Enable **Developer mode** in the top right corner.
3.  Click the **Load unpacked** button.
4.  Select the `dist` folder generated by your build command.
5.  The "Hive Frontend Switcher" icon should appear in your toolbar.

## Usage

### Switching Frontends
1.  **Navigate** to any Hive frontend page (e.g., `https://peakd.com/@alice/test-post`).
2.  **Click** the extension icon.
3.  **Select** the target frontend.
4.  Use the top toggle buttons to switch between **Link**, **Wallet**, or **Post** modes.

### Monitoring Stats
1.  Open the extension and navigate to the **Stats** tab (Activity icon).
2.  Enter your Hive username (e.g., `alice`) and click search.
3.  Your Voting Power (VP) and Resource Credits (RC) will be displayed.
4.  This user is now saved as your "Monitored User".
5.  **Badge:** You can toggle whether the extension icon displays your VP or RC percentage in the Stats view.
6.  **Mini View:** Your stats will also appear on the main "Switcher" screen for quick reference.
