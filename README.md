# Hive Frontend Switcher - Chrome Extension

This is a Chrome Extension built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS that allows users to seamlessly switch between different Hive blockchain interfaces (PeakD, Ecency, Hive.blog, InLeo, Actifit) while preserving your current navigation context.

## Features

*   **Context Preservation:** Detects the current post, profile, or feed you are viewing and redirects you to the exact same page on the target frontend.
*   **Action Modes:**
    *   **Link (Default):** Switches the current view to another frontend.
    *   **Wallet:** Takes you directly to the wallet page on the selected frontend (context-aware: if you are viewing a user's profile, it opens *their* wallet).
    *   **Post:** Opens the "Compose/Publish" editor on the selected frontend.
*   **Navigation Control:** Toggle between opening links in the **Same Tab** (default) or a **New Tab**.
*   **Username Detection:** Automatically extracts usernames from URLs (e.g., `/@alice`) to provide smarter navigation.
*   **Supported Frontends:** PeakD, Ecency, Hive.blog, InLeo, Actifit.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- NPM or Yarn

## Installation & Compilation

1.  **Initialize the project (if you haven't already):**
    If you are creating this from scratch, ensure you have a `package.json`. If not, run:
    ```bash
    npm init -y
    npm install react react-dom lucide-react
    npm install -D typescript @types/react @types/react-dom vite @vitejs/plugin-react tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    ```

2.  **Setup Tailwind:**
    Generate config:
    ```bash
    npx tailwindcss init -p
    ```
    (Note: The code provided uses the CDN version of Tailwind in `index.html` for simplicity in this specific output format, but for a production extension, you should configure the `content` array in `tailwind.config.js` and import CSS in `index.tsx`).

3.  **Build the Extension:**
    Since this is a React app using Vite, you need to build it into static files that Chrome can read.

    Update your `package.json` scripts:
    ```json
    "scripts": {
      "build": "vite build"
    }
    ```

    Create a `vite.config.ts` (if not already present) that is configured to output to a `dist` folder.

    Run the build command:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    *Note: The build process automatically copies `manifest.json` and `icon.svg` to the `dist` folder.*

## Loading into Chrome

1.  Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Enable **Developer mode** in the top right corner.
3.  Click the **Load unpacked** button.
4.  Select the `dist` folder generated by your build command.
5.  The "Hive Frontend Switcher" icon should appear in your toolbar.

## Usage

1.  **Navigate** to any Hive frontend page (e.g., `https://peakd.com/@alice/test-post`).
2.  **Click** the extension icon in your toolbar.
3.  **Choose an Action Mode:**
    *   *Link:* To simply view this post on Ecency/Hive.blog.
    *   *Wallet:* To check @alice's wallet on another interface.
    *   *Post:* To write a new post using a specific frontend's editor.
4.  **Select** the target frontend from the list.
5.  (Optional) Click the "Same Tab / New Tab" toggle in the top right to change how the link opens.
